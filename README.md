## Installation

### Instructions

1. Install Python - I have used Python 3.6 (64-Bit)
2. Make sure pip is installed - use the command `pip` to check
3. Clone this repository
4. Install the requirements - use the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the bot.py file
6. Have fun :)

## Troubleshooting

### Module not found

If this error occours then not all of the modules are installed.  
It is most likely you might of not installed the modules in the `requirements.txt`. In that case, just run `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
If you have and this error is still popping up then look at the error to see what module is missing, remember the name and then run `pip install [package/module]`
